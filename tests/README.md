## Running Tests

### Manual Testing

Use the test scenarios as prompts:

```bash
# Test ownership skill triggering
claude -p "Why am I getting E0382 error?"

# Test unsafe-checker skill
claude -p "Review this unsafe code: unsafe { *ptr }"

# Test crate-researcher agent
claude -p "What's the latest version of tokio?"
```

### Validation Script

```bash
./tests/validation/validate-skills.sh
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Skill Triggering Tests
Verify correct skills are triggered by keywords.

### 2. Content Accuracy Tests
Verify skills provide accurate information.

### 3. Agent Integration Tests
Verify agents fetch data correctly.

### 4. Routing Tests
Verify rust-router routes to correct skills.

### 5. Cache Tests
Verify caching mechanism works.

## Adding New Tests

1. Create scenario file in `tests/scenarios/`
2. Include:
   - Test prompt
   - Expected skill trigger
   - Expected response elements
3. Update validation script if needed
